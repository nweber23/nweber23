## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Currently diving deep into **systems programming at 42 Heilbronn** 🏫, where I explore low-level computing and optimize complex algorithms.  
I'm passionate about understanding how things work under the hood and building efficient, elegant solutions to challenging problems.

> *"The best way to learn is to build, break, and rebuild."*

I'm always looking to contribute to **open-source projects** and collaborate with fellow developers who love systems, performance, and concurrency.
